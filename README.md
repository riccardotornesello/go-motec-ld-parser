# Motec Ld Go

This library allows you to read and write LD (Motec) files with Go.

## Status, feedback and contributions

There are no future updates planned to this library which already has the basic functionality needed to write a file, however I am very happy to receive suggestions and input (e.g. for reading the file) so you are welcome to open an issue or PR if you think adjustments are needed.

## Documentation

There is currently no documentation but there are plans to write documentation in the future. In the meantime you can read the contents of the file.go file which is quite short, the important points are the struct File which contains all the necessary data to be saved and the Write function.
